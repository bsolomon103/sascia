We will carry out a financial assessment to find out how much, if anything, this charge will be.\nIf you qualify for a service, we will offer you a direct payment so that you, or someone who looks after you, can arrange your support in a way that suits you.\nDirect payments mean that you can be your own boss, and employ your own personal assistant to help you to meet your needs and your goals. You can also use direct payments for activities during the day or for short breaks.\nYou might be eligible for free care funded by the NHS.
